0.1:
*auto update over internet
*create zip file with python binaries, git, arduino uploading code
*fix bug in connecting to arduino if there is another COM port
*save experiment_log data after each repetition
*implement feedback
*global voltage/frequency (override per step)
*don't set voltage/frequency if they haven't changed
*save frequency sweep params
*don't add extra step when you frequency sweep
*break ProtocolController into Controller and View
*Redesign protocol class to allow for arbitrary
 step types (check with ResourceManager to dispatch
 functions to the right object)
*view/edit/save experiment log

0.2:
*Arduino: don't block on function calls (e.g. SampleVoltage
 and MeasureImpedance).  Instead, have device notify
 once the command has finished
*Arduino: add commands to RemoteObject for AnalogRead/Write,
 DigitalRead/Write, I2C, SPI (Replace SampleVoltageOB
 with AnalogRead)
*retransmit packets on timeout or CRC error

0.3
*read PCA9505 chip to automaticall get number of channels and state
*calibration functions
*check protocol/version on connect
*switch serialization to JSON
*make serialization upgradeable
*disable gui components if no device is loaded
*disable protocol save/load/rename/etc. unless a device is loaded
*fix case of arduino functions begin() vs. Listen()
*add find method

0.4
*add packet number
*auto set number of channels based on info from device
 (give warning if channel number in protocol exceeds control
 board capability)
*documentation
*Arduino: update MAX_SAMPLES to be max bytes
*list view for protocol
*repeat for step/group
*cut and paste steps
*subprotocols (e.g. dispense) that can be assigned to the
 right-click menu of an electrode

0.5
*PluginManager class to abstract the use of
 different hardware, add custom functionality
*check_int/float should also enforce ranges
*error boxes when communication w/ device fails

0.6
*video capture

0.7
*refactor code into client/daemon

1.0
*make installer (Inno or Nullsoft)
*unit tests
*build tests
*online device database
*store performance data in online repository

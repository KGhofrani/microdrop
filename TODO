TODO:

Next:
*log experiment (save feedback data)
*save/load devices

Later:
*move program logic to model classes (e.g. run_step, save/load protocol should be in protocol class)
*check_int/float should also enforce ranges
*error boxes when communication w/ device fails
*group steps
*list view for protocol
*cut and paste steps
*repeat for steps/groups
*extract droplet velocity
*enable selection of COM port
*config file (current device, current protocol, dirs, etc.)

Future:
*make installer
*video capture
*refactor code into client/daemon
*auto update over internet
*generate documentation
*unit tests
*check types in functions
*build tests
*online device database
*store performance data in online repository

0.2:
*fix case of arduino functions begin() vs. Listen():
  *in dmf_control_board module (functions SampleVoltage and MeasureImpedance
   should not be CamelCase
  *c++ code should follow Arduino conventions
*add pinmode, analog_read/write, I2C, SPI, OneWire
*keyboard shortcuts (left and right arrows for stepping through sequence)
*save experiment_log data after each repetition
*fix device renaming
*fix bug where log directory doesn't exist for new device
*implement feedback
*global voltage/frequency (override per step)
*don't set voltage/frequency if they haven't changed
*save frequency sweep params
*don't add extra step when you frequency sweep

0.3:
*Arduino: don't block on function calls (e.g. SampleVoltage
 and MeasureImpedance).  Instead, have device notify
 once the command has finished
*retransmit packets on timeout or CRC error
*autoupdate
*autofetch binaries (arduino firmware, control board library)
 over the network
*store series resistor values in EEPROM (add config function)
*fix update_and_run.py so that it can run without the console (pytonw) while
 version numbering still works (http://bit.ly/pV2RIX)
*switch serialization to JSON
*make serialization upgradeable
*break ProtocolController into Controller and View
*Redesign protocol class to allow for arbitrary
 step types (check with ResourceManager to dispatch
 functions to the right object)
*view/edit/save experiment log
*list view for protocol

0.4
*read PCA9505 chip to automatically get number of channels and state
*calibration functions
*check protocol/version on connect
*disable gui components if no device is loaded
*disable protocol save/load/rename/etc. unless a device is loaded
*add find method

0.5
*add packet number
*auto set number of channels based on info from device
 (give warning if channel number in protocol exceeds control
 board capability)
*documentation
*Arduino: update MAX_SAMPLES to be max bytes
*repeat for step/group
*cut and paste steps
*subprotocols (e.g. dispense) that can be assigned to the
 right-click menu of an electrode

0.6
*PluginManager class to abstract the use of
 different hardware, add custom functionality
*check_int/float should also enforce ranges
*error boxes when communication w/ device fails

0.7
*video capture
*refactor code into client/daemon

1.0
*unit tests
*build tests
*online device database
*store performance data in online repository
